An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to copy metadata to clipboard and insert it into active file name.

## The Story Behind Copy Metadata

This plugin was developed to address a common user scenario: many users frequently take notes on Obsidian Mobile but find it inconvenient to add a Zettelkasten timestamp to the file name.

While creating quick notes on mobile is effortless, transitioning to Obsidian Desktop often requires renaming those notes. This plugin provides a seamless solution by automatically appending the note creation time to the active file name, streamlining the workflow between mobile and desktop.
